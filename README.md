# Lecture Livecode Example

You can view the final results of the dashboarding live lecture by opening the `dash-project` folder.

To download the `emissions.csv` file:

1. Go to the folder containing the page you want to run.
2. Run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/co2-data/refs/heads/master/owid-co2-data.csv > emissions.csv
```

If you want to run a different page, copy or move the `emissions.csv` file to the relevant folder.
